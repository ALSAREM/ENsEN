Instead of the classical Snippet (small paragraph under the result's title), we propose a multizone, multimedia, interactive Snipppet.\r\nWe modelize the query and its results as RDF graphs, by a process of RDFizing (based on text annotation), then we select the relevant triples in each document's graph, using the two document's representation, i.e. the text (text mining) and the RDF graph (graph connectivity).\r\n\r\n**For more information: **\r\n[http://liris.cnrs.fr/drim/projects/ensen](http://liris.cnrs.fr/drim/projects/ensen)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n> Mazen ALSAREM\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
