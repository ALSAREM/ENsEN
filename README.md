ENsEn: The ENhanced Search ENgine
We introduce the notion of Enhanced Snippets as a result of combining two Webs, Web of documents and Web of data (Linked Data). Instead of the classical Snippet (small paragraph under the result's title), we propose a multi-zone, multimedia, interactive Snip- pet.We modelize the query and its results as RDF graphs, by a process of RDFizing (based on text annotation), then we select the relevant triples in each document's graph, using the two document's representation, i.e. the text (text mining) and the RDF graph (graph connectivity).
